This is just my reference for Arduino information
==========

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
Pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11

Digital Pins have internal pull-up resistors only (20k Ohm)

Pin 13: LED (1k Ohm Resistor)

Hardware Interrupts *
Pin 2: Interrupt 0
Pin 3: Interrupt 1
Example: attachInterrupt(Interrupt_Number, function, TYPE);
TYPES: LOW, CHANGE, RISING, FALLING (Due Only: HIGH)

Serial communication:
Pin 0: Rx
Pin 1: Tx

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit, Two-wire Interface)
Pin A5: SCL (Serial Clock)
Pin A4: SDA (Serial Data Line)

Hardware SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface, Four-wire Interface)
Pin 13: SCK/SCLK (Serial Clock (output from master))
Pin 12: MISO/DO (Master Input, Slave Output (output from slave))
Pin 11: MOSI/DI (Master Output, Slave Input (input from slave))
Pin 10: SS (Slave Select) (recommended)

LEDs:
- Cathode - Shorter Leg, Flat Side
+ Anode - Longer Leg, Round Side

* Note on Interrupt Functions: Inside the attached function, delay() won't work and the value returned by millis() will not increment. Serial data received while in the function may be lost. You should declare as volatile any variables that you modify within the attached function.
